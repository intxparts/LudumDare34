Our story begins with a soul.
The soul did not remember how it got here. 
This is expected as the mind dies with the body. 
There are exceptions of course. Tesla was such an interesting man, soul.

Anyways, judging from the looks of this souls' aura it is probably best that we don't know about its past life.
What horrid things you must have done. 
You must have been a double dipper. 
Yes, I can see it now.
Not only did you forget to wash your hands in the restroom and immediately proceed to grab a carrot from the party bowl. But you returned your half eaten carrot deep into the ranch bowl....

You know what, this isn't the best we can do. 
This story can be told much better if you go stand on the top right platform.
You should consider this a great opportunity to finally start taking the high road.

*Event: Player complies within 30 seconds
- Complies:  - I like your enthusiasm! 
				  - You weren't smart enough to stay on the street curb during rush hour, but you sure can handle jumping to platforms in purgatory. You should be proud!
				  
- Does not comply:
	- Is this how it is going to be? 
	- We have all of eternity to tell this story so maybe we should start trusting one another.


*Event: Player jumps into the abyss below.

Excuse me, but that's rather impolite. 
I'm trying to tell a story about you.

I know you have a hard time staying alive.
Fortunately you're here in purgatory where you can't die or leave in any sense.
